<h2>Hope you enjoy</h2>
<p> This is my fisrt HTML webpage. I created it using proper HTML tags and structure.
Some parts of this paragraph are <b>bold</b> and others are <i>italic</i> to show how formatting works in HTML.
I really enjoyed learning about HTML because it helps me build an understanding of how webpages work!
